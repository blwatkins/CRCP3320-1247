## Code Snippets 

I can have a short snippet using `the backtick char.` It's located on same keyboard button as tab.

```
public class JavaProgram 
{
    public static void main (String[] args) 
    {
        System.out.println("Hello!)
    }
} 
```

<!-- can spesify language and it will highlight -->

```java
public class JavaProgram 
{
    public static void main (String[] args) 
    {
        System.out.println("Hello!)
    }
} 
```
